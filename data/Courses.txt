DECSCI - Decision Sciences Program | Risk | 027139 | Simply put, risk is “the possibility of something bad happening.” Defined in this way, increased attentiveness to risk has the potential to be paralyzing because it is present in nearly every aspect of human existence. This course, organized by the Duke Center on Risk, capitalizes on this ubiquity by bringing together ideas and approaches from all corners of the university. A unifying perspective is the recognition that risk involves elements of both chance (“possibility”) and value (“something bad”). Therefore, students will learn the languages of probability and economics within the cultural settings of public policy, law, engineering, business, and medicine. | FALL

DMNISTRY - Doctor of Ministry | Communication: Inspiring and Guiding Change | 021526 | In this course we will look at what is required to see well and to speak well and to create well as a Christian leader. One of the key roles of a leader of any organization is to define reality. What is going on? Where is God in this? Who are we called to be in response to God? The course will deal with both theologies of writing and actual practices of communicating in a variety of genres. By the end students should feel competent to evaluate publications to which they would like to submit written work for publication. They should be able also to produce their own media through their own outlets (church website, Facebook, blogs etc.) to a fruitful leadership end. | FA-SPR-SU
DMNISTRY - Doctor of Ministry | Integration: Sustaining and Strengthening Mission | 021968 | To be a faithful Christian leader is to commit oneself to "a long obedience in the same direction," to borrow Nietzsche's phrase. The practice of faithful Christian leadership is thus more like running a marathon than competing in a sprint. Often Christian leaders or institutions are able to experience short periods of intense activity and heroic achievement, only to then watch the artificial bubble burst as leadership burns out or bows out. Far fewer are the examples of Christian leaders and institutions who stay the course and who "finish well": who, by God's grace, grow steadily in faithfulness and fruitfulness in a way that is sustainable and lasting | FA-SPR-SU

The aim is to expand our imagination about who God is (and who we, as bearers of God’s image, and friends and disciples of God).  We will ask:  How do people’s images of God—and their resulting images of themselves (sheep? vassals?)—invite them to become (or interfere with their becoming) the people God means us to be? How do images of God help readers of the Bible greet one another as bearers of the image of God? How do we pray to the God who is clothing or fire? Or dog?

HISTTHEO - Historical Theology | Eros and Epectasy: From Plato to Ps-Dionysius | 022498 | One of the major subjects of debate among theologians, ancient and modern, has been how to think about the nature of Christian love. In his famous Agape and Eros, Anders Nygren argued that the incorporation of a Classical and Hellenistic notion of eros into Christian theology marked a corruption of the Biblical concept of agape. The purpose of this class is not to rebut Nygren’s analysis “that has been done by other scholars” rather it is to examine how theologians appropriated the Classical eros tradition. The class will also pay close attention to the question of how the theological commitments of these Christian theologians caused them to change the Classical ideal of eros | FA-SPR-SU

Roger Williams may well deserve the title "America's Theologian" because he was the trailblazer for the liberty of conscience, the freedom of religion, and the separation of church and state which became established as a distinctively American ideal in history, culture, and law.

We will experiment with failure to learn how it can make us better as we develop our skills as innovators, specifically focusing on the earliest stage of creativity: ideation. We will use failure through experimentation as a technique for problem definition and needs discovery which, in turn, will help us validate the quality of our ideas. | FALL-SPRNG

I&E - Innovation & Entrepreneurship | New Ventures Discovery | 027698 | This course is designed to lead you to a eureka moment by teaching you how to explore the world around you for problems worth solving.

INTERDIS - Interdisciplinary | Narrative Medicine for Medical Learners | 024760 | This elective course is a fourth year clinical elective where students will discuss selected works of literature that address the human condition in a way that is meaningful to physicians-in-training. The course is open to third and fourth year medical students. The aim is to incorporate literature into the medical training experience, give students the opportunity to practice reflective writing, and the space to explore the humanistic roots of medicine.  In this course we will examine the intersection between the domains of narrative and medicine through the study of diverse representations of medical issues. Among the questions we will ask are: how does narrative give us greater insight into illness, medical treatment, doctor-patient relationships, and other aspects of health and medicine? How do illness and other experiences within the realm of medicine influence ways of telling stories? How do doctors’ perspectives and patients’ perspectives differ, and what, if anything, should be done to close those differences? Attendance to all sessions is mandatory. However, with advanced approval from the course director, a student may miss one session, but the student must submit a written reflection of the readings for the missed session, as outlined by the course director, in order to receive credit for the course. This course will be offered during the first eight weeks of the spring term. The course will meet once a week for eight weeks, on Wednesday evenings, starting in January, from 5:15p - 7:15p.

Over the course of this time, the forms, perspectives, and practices of Christian worship have varied greatly even as certain issues perennially recur as ongoing questions.

LTS - Liturgical Studies | Twentieth Century Worship Revolutions | 028271 | Incredible—even revolutionary—change has characterized the history of worship in the Western Church since the mid-twentieth century. Yet some Christians might think that the current state of worship is the way it always has been. This history course will dispel that notion by exploring two main impulses for liturgical change in the twentieth century: the rise of Contemporary Praise and Worship and the Liturgical Movement. In the first, a drive toward popular forms of music making has brought global change to Pentecostalism, evangelicalism, and even some mainline denominations. Through the second impulse, a patristic-based vision of liturgy and sacraments has brought about nothing less than an overhaul of worship in Roman Catholicism and mainline Protestant Christianity. Through a historical examination of these developments students can gain better perspective on the presumptions current-day worshipers have about what they consider normal and standard. | FA-SPR-SU
LTS - Liturgical Studies | To Ponder the Mystery: Surveying Christian Theologies of Worship | 029056 | Almost as diverse as Christian expressions of the worship of God has been theological explanations of that worship.

LTS - Liturgical Studies | Baptism and Faith Formation | 015011 | This course offers a vision and strategies for the holistic formation of adult disciples with vocations to serve church and world. In the early church, this process took shape as the “catechumenate,” an intentional web of relationships, practices, and ritual symbols culminating in the Baptismal Rites of Initiation. Its approach to disciple-making was at once communal, sensual, deeply affecting and aesthetically-tuned while also speaking to the intellect. The catechumenate also was supported by a robustly imaginative theology of baptism whose playful and allusive use of symbols, figures and metaphors deepened its doxological character. Present day pastoral leaders should consider this way of formation not only for its lovely (and revelatory!) insights into the redemptive mission of God but also for its wise intuitions about human beings and their motivations. | FALL-SPRNG
LTS - Liturgical Studies | Worship and Christian Formation | 002217 | Theological tradition suggests that human life is expressed and claimed most fully in and through the praise and worship of God. Such a claim, often overlooked by educators and pastors, suggests that Christian liturgy is a critical context for considering issues of education and formation in communities of faith. This course explores how the patterned "holy things" of worship (book, bath, table and calendar) may enact persons into storied identity. It considers how worship offers a curriculum and embodied pedagogy for Christian life. It also examines why the aesthetic "language" of liturgy—symbol, metaphor, ritual action and music—remains an especially effective medium for connecting human beings with grace-filled mystery and or accomplishing transformation in human lives. | FA-SPR-SU

LTS - Liturgical Studies | Survey of Christian Hymnody | 027704 | This course studies the significance and evolution of Christian hymnody. Attention will be given to both the textual and musical aspects of hymns, and how the relationship between text and music influences theological content and faith formation.

LTS - Liturgical Studies | The Role and Function of Music in Corporate Worship | 020190 | This course is both a historical study of music in Christian liturgy, and an exploration of the contemporary issues—theological, communal, and pastoral—pertaining to music in worship and congregational life. Topics for discussion will include genres of church music (e.g. psalmody, chant, hymnody, praise-and-worship, gospel); the role of choirs, cantors, and instruments; clergy/musician relationships; and resources for music and worship planning. | FALL-SPRNG
LTS - Liturgical Studies | Preaching on the Sacraments: Patristic Imitation | 022867 | This course explores patristic examples of using typology and allegory, especially in the 4th century form of preaching known as mystagogy, to name what is experienced in Christian worship. The course will emphasize appropriation of this patristic technique for the creation of sermons, prayers, song texts, and catechesis for the church today | FALL-SPRNG
LTS - Liturgical Studies | Theological Assessment of Worship Song Lyrics | 024124 | One of the most fundamental, recurring tasks of pastoral activity is the vetting of congregational worship songs, including considering their theological content. To better equip future ministers for this task, this course seeks to increase the capacity of students to assess theologically various lyrical expressions of the Christian faith, ancient and modern. By weekly review of small bodies of worship songs, assessed by both the student's theology as well as the assumed perspective of a historical theologian, students will gain facility to address the potential and limitations of poetic articulations of theology | FALL-SPRNG

OPERATNS - Operations | Operations Strategy | 001260 | A firm’s operations are the processes, resources, and capabilities that together produce its goods and services.  The long-term design and control of a firm’s operations to accomplish its strategic goals is referred to as its operations strategy.  In this course, we discuss how to understand, analyze, and design effective operations strategies.  We consider how different operational choices can lead to different levels of performance along four (at least) critical dimensions: cost, quality, flexibility, and speed.  We also introduce a framework that structures the most important operational decisions into three categories, and discuss how to make decisions in these categories that align each dimension of operational performance with the firm’s strategic goals. Finally, we apply this framework to analyze a series of critical problems faced by modern firms, such as developing resilient operations strategies, integrating social and environmental responsibility into operations strategy, scaling operations strategies in start-ups, and integrating breakthrough technology into an operations strategy. | FALL-SPRNG

On this latter note, the course will explore the theological terrain of humanitarianism | FALL-SPRNG
PARISH - Care of Parish | Power, Inequality, and Reconciliation | 023865 | This course introduces students to the theology, psychology, and practices of reconciliation. By examining the nonconscious forces (both individual and social/structural) that perpetuate inequality between cultural groups, this course addresses the ways in which power discrepancies impede reconciliation. This course equips students to assess their own passive and active contributions to discord, evaluate the individual and social/structural factors that impede reconciliation in their own ministry context, and develop a theological and practical strategy to begin to dismantle these factors | FA-SPR-SU
PARISH - Care of Parish | Ethics and Native America: American Indian Literature and Liturgy | 023866 | This course serves as an introduction to American Indian literature, with three aims: (1) to explore the history and legacy of the nineteenth and twentieth-century devastation of Indian cultures, especially in the Western United States, in the face of "manifest destiny"; (2) to frame this history and legacy in liturgical terms, that is, in the terms of the loss and/or survival of the "rituals of ultimate concern" or "thick practices" that are constitutive of cultural identity; and (3) to use this liturgical lens as a way of confronting the ethical stakes, both past and present, of the relationship between the United States of America and Native America | FA-SPR-SU
PARISH - Care of Parish | Principles and Methods of Intercultural Leadership | 024636 | This course provides an overview of the intersection of culture and leadership.

PARISH - Care of Parish | Cultivating Thriving Communities | 026679 | What are the conditions that enable a community to thrive? What roles can and should congregations play as catalysts, conveners, and curators in cultivating thriving communities? How can you better understand your own community context, discern roles you might be able to play, and mobilize for more effective action and engagement? In this course we will explore ideas and issues from several disciplinary perspectives, using a theological lens throughout. We will draw on literature from the social sciences that point to the significant role that “local” and “regional” contexts can play in addressing challenges and offering constructive solutions. We will pay specific attention to (historical as well as contemporary) stories of thriving | FA-SPR-SU
PARISH - Care of Parish | Women and Spiritual Memoir | 002581 | This seminar explores the themes of faith, community and pastoral vocation by means of religious autobiographies and pastoral memoirs ranging from Augustine to Merton to the present.

PARISH - Care of Parish | Women in Ministry | 022493 | In this course, we will pursue a theologically informed and theologically imaginative investigation of the challenges and opportunities that women in ministry encounter.  The course centrally investigates women working in ordained ministry in a congregational setting, but readings and discussion will be capacious enough to include, inter alia, chaplaincy, lay ministry, and so forth | FALL-SPRNG
PARISH - Care of Parish | Theology and Social Science | 023190 | Drawing on both the history and the contemporary state of the social or human sciences, this course puts theology in conversation with these disciplines (e.g., sociology, cultural anthropology, psychology, political science, and public policy) by considering both the sources of methodological conflicts and possibilities for methodological collaboration | FALL-SPRNG
PARISH - Care of Parish | Ministry with Millennials | 023496 | The "Millennials" (those born after 1980 or so) are often described in faith communities as the "missing demographic." This is likely true if we are looking for them in the pews at 11:00am on Sunday morning. They are not, however, missing from places of substance and engagement, often the very places where communities of faith take a stand for truth and justice. It is incumbent on faith communities both to reach into the places where millennials are "living, moving, and having being," and to reclaim our rich heritage of standing with the lost and forgotten of this world | FALL-SPRNG
PARISH - Care of Parish | Disunity in Christ: Difference, Conflict, and Resolution in the Church | 024125 | From aesthetic conflict over the color of the sanctuary carpet to deeper theological conflicts, this course introduces students to the theology, psychology, and practices of conflict resolution in church-based settings. By examining the ways in which individual and cultural differences impact both the self and group, this course explores theological and psychological pathways to conflict resolution. Drawing from the field of reconciliation studies, this course equips students to assess the impact of difference on interpersonal and intergroup conflict, understand the theories and practices of conflict resolution, and develop a theological and practical model for conflict resolution | FALL-SPRNG
PARISH - Care of Parish | U.S. Food Policy | 027493 | The U.S. food supply is a series of intersecting actors: farmers, food processors, food retailers, and consumers. However, these actors are in a complex system of policies such as the U.S. Farm Bill, which includes agricultural support programs, nutrition policies, and environmental regulations. Beyond the policy realm, for-profit (agribusiness and food manufacturers) and non-profit (food banks and faith-based organizations) actors engage and respond to this food system. Informed by systems thinking, the goal of the course is to provide learners tools to understand and engage the U.S. food system | FA-SPR-SU
PARISH - Care of Parish | Global Food Policy | 027494 | Globalization continuously shapes and reshapes our food systems. We benefit from international trade, yet we critique the system in which sustains us. Global value chains connect some of the world’s poorest farmers to the wealthiest consumers through products like cacao (chocolate), fish, and rice. This course will serve as an interdisciplinary approach to international trade of agriculture and food. Drawing from economics, sociology, and business and informed by ethics, this course will explore the reasons nations exchange goods and services, particularly food and agricultural products. The course will assess the implications of these exchanges on people and the planet, given the underlying profit motives. Learners will engage the private and public policy frames that support and shape globalized food systems | FA-SPR-SU
PARISH - Care of Parish | Charitable Foods | 027492 | Churches have been the center of U.S. emergency food assistance since its creation. Fundamentally, nutrition support has roots in biblical mandates. This course will explore how people of faith provide support to individuals in need. This course will draw upon field experiences with local food assistance programs and international non-profits. Learners will also engage individuals who benefit from these programs. We will assess the challenges of these efforts and develop constructive, alternative approaches to providing food for people in need | FA-SPR-SU
PARISH - Care of Parish | Food, Faith, and Health | 028800 | This course considers the role that congregations can play in fostering food economies —ranging from food production, distribution, and consumption —that promote the health of persons, communities, and the places in which they live. | FA-SPR-SU
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Introduction to the Ministry of Social Work | 015842 | This course will review the historical origins of care for marginalized persons, and explore theological foundations for the practices of social work. We will examine the ways ministers and Christian social workers have historically and conceptually understood their identities and the convergences/divergences of Christian ministry and social work. We will also consider ways that a Christian spirituality might inform both the practices and the identity of a social worker. The city of Durham and its renaissance, limitations, and change agents will serve as a case study to illustrate the main principles of this class | FALL
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Pastoral Care through Anxiety and Depression | 025574 | This course will examine the psychological, theological, and cultural aspects of anxiety and depression and ask the question of how to understand hope in the midst of such suffering. Students will grapple with the range of difficult sometimes paralyzing feelings brought on by anxiety and depression and begin to explore how to frame the equally powerful notion of hope, theological and otherwise. How does a pastor offer practical and spiritual support in times of crisis as well as over the long-term course of this illness? | FALL-SPRNG
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Ministry and Care in the Contexts of Displacement and Loss | 026231 | This course will prepare pastors for caregiving encounters with persons and communities facing the loss of one’s “home place.” Contexts for care include the elderly who can no longer live in their homes, situations of poverty (eviction or foreclosure), natural disasters such as hurricanes or fire, persons facing incarceration as well as first generation immigrants and refugees. Students will learn about the physical, psychological, spiritual challenges that face the unexpected crisis accompanying the loss of home as well as the ways unjust social and political systems often perpetuate this crisis. Throughout this course students will work to develop a theology of suffering relevant to the context of human displacement and begin to envision what hope might look like, practically and theologically, in each context | FALL-SPRNG
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | The Care of Souls and the Ethics of War | 027714 | War is a political and moral activity.  While the experiences of going to war and returning home are often framed in psychological language, the phenomenon of “moral injury” makes clear that war must be considered in moral and political context if these experiences are to be understood.  This course aims to bring together the moral and pastoral dimensions of going to war and coming home.  We will engage participation in war, including moral injury, within the context of Christian traditions around war, moral and political theological accounts of American war, and the moral agency of soldiers. We will also examine the pastoral and prophetic roles of military chaplains | FA-SPR-SU
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Death, Dying, and Bereavement | 028740 | This course is intended to equip those in pastoral or lay ministry with an understanding of the theological and psychological responses to death, dying, loss, and grief while also building skills in caregiving in these contexts. In particular we will explore the physical process of dying, human responses to various types of loss, the grief process, and pastoral care strategies for care with the dying and bereaved. We will pay special attention to pastoral care to the dying and bereaved in this time of Covid and the challenges it presents. This course will embrace a perspective that embraces ways of living creatively in response to these very human experiences and seeks to locate the sacred in the journey of death and grief and embraces the concept of hope, particularly the transition of hope. | FA-SPR-SU
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Theology and Trauma | 021106 | Trauma and its aftermath is an all-too-present reality in our culture and within Christian congregations. "Trauma" and its clinical correlate, post-traumatic stress disorder, have also become increasingly common modes of description within pastoral theology, cultural studies, and mental health practice. In this course we will focus on how congregations (and pastors in particular) can helpfully and faithfully care for survivors of trauma, not only through close attention to the lived reality of traumatic disruption but also through critical consideration of the way that "trauma" functions as an interpretive category which can both aid and hinder theological narration | FALL-SPRNG
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Theology, Mental Health and Human Flourishing | 021908 | By the end of the semester, students will be able a) to articulate and to locate themselves within a distinctively Christian contextual account of health and human flourishing and b) to engage practical, pastoral issues of mental health and mental illness within this contextual account | FALL-SPRNG
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Discipleship and Disability | 019088 | Questions of human limitation, impairment, and disability animate both historical and contemporary theological thought. Contemporary movements of disability rights, disability pride, and the field of disability studies all provide critical conversation partners for Christian disciples. This course will explore material from disabled and non-disabled authors in Christian theology and ethics, disability studies, and popular media. This course emphasizes critical and interdisciplinary reflection on the implications of the human experience of disability for Christian ethical praxis and pastoral care. Key course themes include access, care, healing, and disability justice. | FA-SPR-SU
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | The Disabled Church | 027708 | This course explores how the human experience of disability comes to bear upon ecclesiologies, ecclesial practices, pastoral care, and ecclesial leadership among both disabled and non-disabled lay persons and clergy. Drawing upon the work of scholars, practitioners, and pastors across the ecumenical spectrum, the course will aid students in exploring key questions at the intersections of disability, theology, and access. Specific course emphases include Christian practices and theologies of prayer, biblical interpretation, preaching, baptism, communion, and formation | FA-SPR-SU
PASTCARE - Pastoral Care | Ministry and Care in the Contexts of Displacement and Loss | 026231 | This course will prepare pastors for caregiving encounters with persons and communities facing the loss of one’s “home place.” Contexts for care include the elderly who can no longer live in their homes, situations of poverty (eviction or foreclosure), natural disasters such as hurricanes or fire, persons facing incarceration as well as first generation immigrants and refugees. Students will learn about the physical, psychological, spiritual challenges that face the unexpected crisis accompanying the loss of home as well as the ways unjust social and political systems often perpetuate this crisis. Throughout this course students will work to develop a theology of suffering relevant to the context of human displacement and begin to envision what hope might look like, practically and theologically, in each context | FALL-SPRNG

PREACHNG - Preaching | Cross Cultural Preaching | 025631 | Considering diverse contexts within preaching has proven to be a particularly difficult task for theological educators. Within introductory preaching classes, it is often confined to a single class session in which various contextual differences are named (racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, urban/rural, denominational) in much the same way that Augustine listed them in The First Catechetical Instruction. The naming of all these points of divergence often leaves the instructor with little time to explore how preaching might be affected by these contextual differences. We simply assert, as Augustine did, that it is so: “For it cannot fail to be the case that different persons should affect in different ways the one who intends to instruct orally and likewise the one who intends to give a formal discourse.” Prerequisite: Preaching 758 or Church Ministry 760 | FALL-SPRNG

Students will engage texts, audio-visual sermon recordings, their own oral interpretations of scripture, and live sermon events as theological resources. For preachers, the course will provide a variety of performative approaches to the work of textual interpretation in a living community. For budding homileticians, the class supplies strategies for analyzing sermon performances and asks that these future teachers of preaching to construct their own working theologies of the sermon event to guide their pedagogical practice.

PUBPOL - Public Policy | Capacity Development | 023488 | Over the last forty years our understanding of the what, the why, and the how of capacity development has continued to evolve. While there remain challenges in gaining agreement on which practices are most effective, what we do know is that those efforts which are most enduring include a multi-pronged approach working at the various levels. During this course we’ll look at: various dimensions of capacity development; individual, organizational, and environmental; the role of training, learning, and performance in developing capacity at the various levels; the role of systems thinking and practice in capacity development; and fragile and conflict-affected states and capacity development. | FALL
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Public Policy Writing Practicum | 023300 | Good writing comes from good thinking. In most cases, the biggest problem in "bad writing" is not bad grammar but poor style. We have all heard advice like "be clear" or "never use the passive," but what we need is to understand how to write clearly and why the passive may or may not be a good option. This mini-seminar will introduce a simple system of writing style that can be learned and put to use immediately. (Please bring your computer to class.)

Instructor consent required. | FALL
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Poverty Reduction and the International Financial Institutions | 019230 | Over the last 50 years, development and poverty reduction have been the twin concerns of the International Financial Institutions (the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the regional development banks). The course will trace the evolution of international poverty reduction theory, policy and implementation from the emphasis on capital accumulation and large infrastructure projects in the 1960s to the integrated rural development programs and basic needs approaches of the 1970s, through structural adjustment and sectoral programs in the 1980s and 1990s, to today's emphasis on debt relief and Poverty Reduction Strategies. As these changes were happening, related changes also were taking place in the structures, policies, and practices of the IFIs. The course will, look at the rationale, basic features, and effectiveness of each poverty reduction approach, as well as the accompanying changes in the two principal IFIs, the World Bank and the 1MF. The course will use general studies and reviews, as well as actual project and program examples. The course is primarily a group discussion, with occasional mini-lectures and student presentations.

Attention will be focused on the principal stakeholders, their motivations and capacity, and the quality of interaction among the various players (governments, bilateral donors, multilateral institutions, and NGOs). It will also evaluate the results achieved and the prospects for future success. Special reference will be given to Africa, the center of much of the evolving debate surrounding aid effectiveness. The course is primarily a group discussion, with occasional mini-lectures, student presentations, debates, case studies, and a final simulation exercise. Instructor consent required. | SPRING
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Innovation and Policy Entrepreneurship | 019233 | Innovative approaches are increasingly seen as key to solving difficult, complex or new challenges in this century, whether the challenges are local survival in the face of persistent droughts or boosting productivity to meet global competition.  It is policy entrepreneurship that is needed to craft the policy innovations or the frameworks that encourage innovation and private sector entrepreneurship.  This course will focus on the analytical tools and skills needed by policy makers and analysts to build and sustain an enabling policy environment for innovations and entrepreneurship to occur at global, country and local levels. | SPRING
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Project Management for International Development | 023483 | A significant proportion of international development assistance is offered in the form of complex projects. The management of such projects is challenging and quite different from the management of repetitive day-to-day operations. In addition, the environment for international development projects presents further challenges for the project manager. we will explore in some detail three of the most important phases of the project life cycle-project identification, project design and implementation planning-before considering how the project manager builds and leads the project team, manages risk and monitors and controls implementation towards a successful conclusion. | FALL-SPRNG

It covers the range of contractual arrangements open to governments to construct, maintain and operate infrastructure services and facilities such as hospitals and schools, as well as service provision in varied contexts in the world. Key concerns we address are the identification, analysis, allocation and management of risks and incentives under different contractual arrangements, including the guidelines and criteria that are appropriate to analyze and implement PPPs. | SPRING
PUBPOL - Public Policy | International Energy System, Sustainable Development and Security | 023486 | One of the main challenges for the 21st century policy-makers is how to develop and manage adequate. affordable and reliable energy services to fuel sustainable social and economic development. Thus far, in many countries energy production and use have been inefficient and unsustainable, resulting in missed development opportunities and/or serious policy failures, aggravation of international and domestic conflicts, and wasted resources and environmental damage. The course explores why these problems occur and what are the implications of the most recent shifts in global energy patterns for global economy and politics. | SPRING
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Social Hierarchies and Health: Race, Ethnicity, Tribal Affiliation and Caste | 028850 | This course utilizes transnational comparisons to examine health inequities by socially constructed categories of human distinction, stratified hierarchies of differential human valuation and institutionalized social bias. The course opens by examining US specific racial and SES health disadvantage. It then addresses health inequity for a diverse range of international social systems. A central thesis of the course holds that health inequity is a manifestation of physically embodied stress from differences in lived experience that impact health beyond the effects of SES, individual behavior, health insurance, and medical care. | SPRING
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Conflict, Security and Development | 023487 | The course aims to explore the "development-security-conflict" nexus. The linkages between insecurity and rising levels of inequality and poverty are many and complex. High levels of conflict and societal fragility undermine prospects of achieving "freedom from want." Meantime, development strategies, policies and programs that often generate 'winners' and 'losers' may sow seeds for violent conflict. The course explores what spurs risks of violence, why conflict prevention and recovery have proven difficult to address and how national governments and their international development partners can design policies that can simultaneously address development and peace. | SPRING
PUBPOL - Public Policy | Human Rights and Conflict | 019891 | One story of the relationship between human rights and conflict is told in the Preamble to the UN Charter: the human rights framework of our age came about because of the 20th century's two world wars. But for the "untold sorrow" brought about by these conflicts, so the story goes, there would have been no effective demand for and no construction of a set of legal, political and ethical norms intended to help "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war". In this course we will examine the link between human rights and conflict in an interdisciplinary fashion. What are the multiple ways in which the law and political advocacy of human rights relate to conflict? Do demands for human rights precipitate or fuel as much as prevent-conflicts, whether as war or in other forms of large scale suffering? Are human rights essential for what the field of conflict resolution has termed "positive peace"? Should policymakers involved in multiple stages of conflict, both inter-and intrastate, be more cautious about viewing rights as a remedy for conflicts? What are relevant ethical considerations? With the benefit of greater analytical and contextual understanding of competing priorities and tradeoffs, what positive role might be cast for human rights in the conflicts of the 21st century? To consider these and other questions, we will draw substantially on historical and policy analyses, learning the legal/political history of the contemporary framework for human rights and connecting it to real world efforts underway by lawyers and other practitioners to reframe and transform conflict and build peace. Consent required by instructor. | FALL

PUBPOL - Public Policy | Governance and Development | 023485 | Exactly how governance, economic growth, and poverty reduction are interrelated is a subject of much controversy. The first part of this course will explore questions such as "What is governance?" "What does good governance mean?" "How is it measured?" "What is the relationship among governance, growth, and poverty reduction?" "Does good governance necessarily mean democratic governance?" From there, the course will move on to selected topics central to the good governance agenda, including public sector reform, corruption, and decentralization. The course will end with a look at global influences on developing country governance. | SPRING

RELIGION - Religion | Christianity's Encounter with Other Religions and Cultures: The Case of East Asia | 028301 | The modern encounter between Christianity and other religions and cultures occurred primarily in the context of a vigorous and sustained missionary movement launched in the West.

How did they strike the balance between faithfulness to the core of the Christian faith and adapting the Gospel to the languages, sensibilities, and the needs of the societies and cultures they encountered? How did the pioneers relate to local communities and structures of power? What role did power relationships play in their work? How did their work facilitate (or impede) the subsequent emergence of local forms of Christianity? We will consider these in the context of—and in response to—post-colonial critiques of missionaries’ involvement in Western imperialism. Some terms this course will offer travel component. | FALL-SPRNG

This course explores how the patterned "holy things" of worship (book, bath, table and calendar) may enact persons into storied identity. It considers how worship offers a curriculum and embodied pedagogy for Christian life. It also examines why the aesthetic "language" of liturgy—symbol, metaphor, ritual action and music—remains an especially effective medium for connecting human beings with grace-filled mystery and or accomplishing transformation in human lives. | FA-SPR-SU

In the early church, this process took shape as the “catechumenate,” an intentional web of relationships, practices, and ritual symbols culminating in the Baptismal Rites of Initiation. Its approach to disciple-making was at once communal, sensual, deeply affecting and aesthetically-tuned while also speaking to the intellect. The catechumenate also was supported by a robustly imaginative theology of baptism whose playful and allusive use of symbols, figures and metaphors deepened its doxological character. Present day pastoral leaders should consider this way of formation not only for its lovely (and revelatory!) insights into the redemptive mission of God but also for its wise intuitions about human beings and their motivations. | FALL-SPRNG

XTIANEDU - Christian Education | Eating Together Faithfully: Education for Christian Foodways | 026278 | This course in Christian education for faith formation offers pastors, teachers and other Christian community leaders the opportunity to imagine, practice and reflect upon meal sharing as a focal point of communal life. Utilizing Rev. Grace Hackney’s innovative curricular framework, Eating Together Faithfully, students will participate in reflective conversations about food justice while sharing simple meals together around a table. Along the way they will acquire crucial skills for shaping hospitable learning communities, asking good questions, and leading reflective, honest, and open conversations. Students will also consider the potential for close (even organic) relationships between education for faith formation and other central practices of worship and mission. | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANEDU - Christian Education | Christian Education for Public Ministry | 028269 | In response to multiple social crises, Christian education scholars are calling for faith communities to reclaim their "public ministries" including public theologizing for the common good, prophetic witness, advocacy, and community engagement for social justice. This course, open to all students of the Divinity School, explores these themes and practices through the proposals of African American educational scholars, faith leaders, and churches in the USA.  It attends to Spirit-filled worship where righteous anger and lament are juxtaposed to hope and joy; to teaching prophetic readings of scripture and cultivating prophetic imagination; to empowering leaders (including youth) for advocacy; and to building coalitions with community allies beyond the walls of churches. All of this envisions Christian participation in the realization of social justice in the USA. | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Health Care in Theological Context I | 020188 | This is the first course in a two-semester sequence that engages modern health care from the perspective of Christian history, theology, and practice. Whereas modern biomedicine took shape within the past two centuries, Christians draw on more than 3000 years of reflection, struggle, and innovation around health and illness, suffering and care. This course explores ways that Christian thought and practice has influenced the development of modern health care as well as Christian practices and resources for engaging health, illness, disability, suffering, and dying. Students explore the meaning of health, the doctrine of the imago dei, the healing ministry of Jesus and the early church, the relation of Jesus’ suffering to human suffering, the relation of Christian thought to modern biomedicine, the relationship of individual and community health, and the connection between health and justice. | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Sin in Contemporary North American Literature | 022487 | Two working assumptions form this course.  First, sin is a theological concept with which even beginning divinity students have ample experience.  Second, narrative is helpful for engaging the original ways sin shapes individual human lives and particular communities.  This course will consider sin, exploring error, evil, and suffering alongside truth, hope, and healing in six different stories.  Authors have narrated sin as social and as personal in mainstream, North American storytelling—as a matter of lies writ large and as a result of individual choice | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Health Care in Theological Context II | 023490 | This is the second course in a two-semester sequence, which aims to help students wisely and faithfully to interpret and make use of contemporary systems and practices of health care in their interactions with patients, parishioners, and health care practitioners. Whereas modern biomedicine took shape within the past two centuries, Christians draw on more than 3000 years of reflection, struggle, and innovation around health and illness, suffering and care. In this two-semester course, students explore Christian traditions regarding health, illness, and practices of caring for the body, using these traditions as lenses to understand, appreciate, and critique contemporary health care practices. In this second course (spring semester), we build on what was learned in the fall to focus on the ethical questions that emerge in the practices of health care. | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Health and Holiness | 025571 | This course explores the complex relationship between the notions “health” and “holiness.” Beginning with an intuition based on the common linguistic ancestry of the two English words and proceeding from explicit and implied connections made by biblical authors, we will examine health and its convergences with holiness from the perspectives of philosophy, theology, and medicine.  In our efforts to come to a theologically adequate understanding of health, we will consider: 1) health as the flourishing of the organism/body/person; 2) health as a function of community, understood as “a place and all its creatures”; 3) health as a (common) way of life; 4) health as the telos of medicine; 5) the proper limits of healthcare and the pursuit of health. It is strongly recommended that students complete a basic theology course prior to taking this course | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | The Care of Souls and the Ethics of War | 027714 | War is a political and moral activity.  While the experiences of going to war and returning home are often framed in psychological language, the phenomenon of “moral injury” makes clear that war must be considered in moral and political context if these experiences are to be understood.  This course aims to bring together the moral and pastoral dimensions of going to war and coming home.  We will engage participation in war, including moral injury, within the context of Christian traditions around war, moral and political theological accounts of American war, and the moral agency of soldiers. We will also examine the pastoral and prophetic roles of military chaplains | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Topics in Ethics | 018538 | Topics vary. May be repeated for credit | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | War in the Christian Tradition | 002264 | Christianity is a language that people who write words about war use to justify war. This class will consider words about war, beginning with political speeches. We will focus on war in the concrete, not the abstract. Primary documents will be political speeches given by Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. We will consider recent words on the “Just War” tradition and on pacifism, drawing on essays available online. We will also consider ways that politicians have used fear to fuel small scale wars in homes, neighborhoods, and grocery stores. All assigned viewings will be available online. We will use primarily speeches, films. podcast, and archived cartoons to consider how Christian images function to justify war | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Sex, Gender, and Discipleship | 013888 | We will focus on definitions of sex, of gender, and of discipleship. Documentaries include “Before Stonewall” and “After Stonewall.” We will spend several weeks on “I Am Not Your Negro.” I will ask you to consider which movie in your memory most connotes sexy, where you first learned about gender, who talked to you about sex, and why | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Advanced Theological Bioethics | 002278 | This course takes up questions about life, community, health, suffering, and death, with particular attention to medical systems and practices in the United States. We examine how those question are addressed (or not) in the typical discourses of bioethics, but we focus particularly on theological and pastoral approaches. Often the course will use the anthology, On Moral Medicine (Eerdmans) as an anchoring text, and other readings may include essays, novels, and poems. Recommended prerequisite: Christian Theology 755 and Christian Ethics 757 or equivalents. | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Discipleship and Disability | 019088 | Questions of human limitation, impairment, and disability animate both historical and contemporary theological thought. Contemporary movements of disability rights, disability pride, and the field of disability studies all provide critical conversation partners for Christian disciples. This course will explore material from disabled and non-disabled authors in Christian theology and ethics, disability studies, and popular media. This course emphasizes critical and interdisciplinary reflection on the implications of the human experience of disability for Christian ethical praxis and pastoral care. Key course themes include access, care, healing, and disability justice. | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Soren Kierkegaard | 011619 | Without prior knowledge of Kierkegaard or philosophy, this course offers engagement with primary texts drawn from the following works of Søren Kierkegaard: Fear and Trembling, Repetition, Either/Or, Stages on Life's Way, Philosophical Fragments, and Works of Love.

The course also serves as an introduction to Christian approaches to social, political and economic witness. Basic categories churches use to frame social and political engagement will be explored; for example, "neighbor love" and "prophecy"; as well as some concepts and dynamics that are present but not used, such as "power," "self-interest," and "politics." | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Christianity and Capitalism: A Theological Exploration | 024122 | This course aims to understand capitalism and its operations as a theological and spiritual phenomenon. It will do so by, in the first part of the course, examining the intersection of our talk of God and our talk of economics, identifying how each circulates in the other. Key terms and semantic fields through which conceptions of economic life and divine-human relations intersect will be analyzed through drawing on scriptural, doctrinal, historical and social scientific material. Then, key theological responses that emerged at a particular point of intersection between a form of capitalism and a particular instantiation of “world Christianity” within a specific context will be examined. Prerequisites: Christian Theology 755, Christian Ethics 757, and at least one Historical Theology course. | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | End of Life Care and Theological Ethics | 026685 | This course is a conceptual and theological reflection on some of the ethical issues that emerge in the context of health care at the end of life (EOL).

XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Womanist Bioethics | 027712 | This course examines the ways that various theologies which center marginalized populations in moral reasoning can influence the methodology and content of contemporary bioethics. The course will investigate historical critiques of bioethics with respect to addressing the needs of marginalized populations and critically analyze the significant import that womanist, feminist, and mujerista theologies have for bioethics.  Specific bioethics cases provide the foundation for examining Black women’s and other vulnerable populations’ (including Native American, Indigenous Pacific Islander, poor rural whites, Latinx, immigrants) experience, empowerment, and health outcomes.  Various theological and philosophical perspectives will inform our understanding of the ways in which difference (class, race, gender, ability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity) structures individuals’ interactions with the health care system | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANETH - Christian Ethics | Food, Faith, and Health | 028800 | This course considers the role that congregations can play in fostering food economies —ranging from food production, distribution, and consumption —that promote the health of persons, communities, and the places in which they live. | FA-SPR-SU

XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Theology of Rowan Williams | 026302 | This course aims to provide an introduction to the theology of Rowan Williams, one of the most influential and wide-ranging English-speaking theologians of our time. Williams written work engages a wide array of theological themes and topics, and while this course seeks to give students a sense of this breadth, it will focus especially on the Christological and trinitarian determinants of his thought. His theology finds expression in a striking variety of modes and genres, directed to a diversity of audiences. This course will seek to demonstrate how his conception of the theological task, grounded as it is in Christology and the Trinity, requires these different modes and genres. Hence, in addition to systematic, historical and philosophical texts, the course will entail reading sermons, lectures and addresses (for various contexts), poetry, devotional writings, and semi-popular theology.

XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Transhumanism, Theology, and Embodiment | 027496 | Society understands embodiment as incomplete, unsound, and limited by frailty, mortality, and illness.  Embodiment is equated with vulnerability and has been historically problematized within theology and philosophy.  Theology provides the basis for restoring and healing that is needed due to dissatisfaction with “failed bodies”, and due to discrimination, exclusion, and violence against bodies that do not measure up to a mediated norm. Transhumanism is offered by some as a solution to humanity’s struggle with the limitations of embodiment, particularly, as a response to “failed bodies”. Thus, this class will engage questions such as: What should be the Christian response to soteriological and eschatological visions offered by transhumanism that help humans cope with the dissatisfaction that arises from embodiment?  How do particular Christian communities help humans deal with the onslaught of dissatisfaction that arises from embodiment?  What stigmatizing and detrimental narratives does theology undergird within faith communities regarding embodiment? | FA-SPR-SU

XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Mystical Theology | 027910 | This course explores the tradition of Christian mysticism and its contribution to addressing some challenges within contemporary theology. Mysticism will be understood as holistic commitment to the claim that the triune God of Christian worship is both active and accessible within the life of the church for the sake of its life and witness. Although precarious and at times unwieldy and misunderstood, Christian mysticism has the potential to animate and vivify the theological task this side of modernity’s reductions. | FA-SPR-SU

XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Love and Desire | 028122 | This course has two Biblical starting points: the dominical command to love the Lord your God with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your mind, and all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself.  (Mark 12.20-31), and the Song of Songs.

Readings will focus on texts from the modern period with complementary materials from biblical and ancient sources that name and explore key components of faithful witness | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Roger Williams: Life and Thought | 017144 | The historic importance of Roger Williams cannot be limited to that of a sectarian firebrand who challenged Puritan authorities, befriended Indian neighbors, founded the colony of Rhode Island, and established the First Baptist Church in America.  Roger Williams may well deserve the title "America's Theologian" because he was the trailblazer for the liberty of conscience, the freedom of religion, and the separation of church and state which became established as a distinctively American ideal in history, culture, and law.  This course will examine the life and thought of Roger Williams through a careful reading of his writings with attention to both their historical context and contemporary relevance | FA-SPR-SU
XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | John Henry Newman: Life & Thought | 021110 | John Henry Newman was born in 1801 and died in 1890. He was the central figure in the so-called Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s, and among the most effective and widely-read theological controversialists writing in English in the nineteenth century. This course will explore his life and thought | FALL-SPRNG
XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Chalcedonian Christology | 025573 | After the Scriptures and the Nicene Creed, the Chalcedonian Definition is the single most influential statement of Christ’s identity in the history of Christian theology. It defines the orthodoxy of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches; it plays a major role in the magisterial Protestant traditions; and it remains an important resource for constructive theologians today. Yet to many of equally orthodox pedigree, the doctrine of Chalcedon is misleading at best and dogmatically corrupt at worst. Despite the intention of Emperor Marcian to unify the Christian world, the council that he tightly controlled instead led to a permanent schism in Eastern church; it heightened East-West tensions in the centuries that followed; and it produced significant theological difficulties in later periods, from the Christological disagreements among Western medieval scholastics to fierce debates between Lutheran and Reformed theologians to more recent discussions of the perceived Nestorianism of much nineteenth-and twentieth-century Western theology.

XTIANTHE - Christian Theology | Modern Christology and Chalcedon | 025911 | This seminar will examine the Christologies of key Eastern and Western modern theologians. We will focus on identifying patterns of biblical interpretation, doctrinal argumentation, and metaphysical definition in modern uses, or reactions against, the Chalcedonian conception(s) of Christ. Recurring topics will include the picture of Christ given in the “plain” sense of Scripture; the "communicatio idiomatum," or cross-predication of divine and human statements in the biblical texts; the "perichoresis" of the divine and human natures or attributes in Christ; the categories of nature and hypostasis; God’s suffering in the incarnation; the various patterns of Christological exegesis that accompany these positions (single-subject, double-subject, hybrid, etc.); the metaphysical schemes employed for defining Christ’s identity; and the nearly constant exegetical, liturgical, and soteriological dimensions thereof.
