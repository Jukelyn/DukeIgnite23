Duke Ignite '23 Project
<hr/>

# TODO
<li> Implement Chat Bot functionality using gpt
<li> Setup venv and change setup to use venv
<li> Python 3.8.16 but anything 3.7.1 up to but not including 3.10 should be fine. (3.10 probably works but not for me for some odd reason... currently investigating)

# How to setup
<li> Insall dotenv python package `pip install python-dotenv`
<li> Put your api token into a `.env` file as `TOKEN='aijraioni1n31'` (example)
<li> Put your GPT token into the `.env` file as well as `GPT-TOKEN='sk-longrandomstuff` (example btw)
<li> The data should already be in the `data` directory however if it's out of date and you want to update it, run ONCE... takes about an hour btw...

# Important
Courses are organized into Subjects. Each Course has a unique course id, duplicated courses have the same id but may exist in different subjects (ECE250 and CS250 both have the same course id)
