# How to setup
- Install `dotenv` Python package: `pip install python-dotenv`
- Put your API token into a `.env` file as `TOKEN='your-api-token-here'` (example)
- Put your GPT token into the `.env` file as well as `GPT-TOKEN='your-gpt-token-here'` (example)
- The data should already be in the `data` directory. However, if it's out of date and you want to update it, run once... this may take about an hour

# Important
Courses are organized into Subjects. Each Course has a unique course ID, and duplicated courses have the same ID but may exist in different subjects (e.g., ECE250 and CS250 both have the same course ID).
